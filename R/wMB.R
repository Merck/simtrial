#' Magirr and Burman Modestly Weighted Logrank Tests
#'
#' Magirr and Burman (2019) have proposed a weighted logrank test to have better power than
#' the logrank test when the treatment effect is delayed, but to still maintain good power under
#' a proportional hazards assumption.
#' The weights for some early interval specified by the user are the inverse of the combined treatment group
#' empirical survival distribution; see details.
#' After this initial period, weights are constant at the maximum of the previous weights.
#' Another advantage of the test is that under strong null hypothesis that the underlying survival in the control group
#' is greater than or equal to underlying survival in the experimental group,
#' Type I error is controlled as the specified level.
#'
#' This function computes Magirr-Burman weights and adds them to a dataset created by the \code{tensurv()} function.
#' These weights can then be used to compute a Z-statistic for the modestly weighted logrank test proposed.
#'
#' @param x a \code{tensurv}-class \code{tibble} with a counting process dataset
#' @param delay The initial delay period where weights increase;
#' after this, weights are constant at the final weigh in the delay period
#' @return a vector with weights for the Magirr-Burman weighted logrank test
#' for the data in \code{x}
#' @details
#' We define \eqn{t^*} to be the input variable \code{delay}.
#' This specifies an initial period during which weights increase.
#' To define specific weights, we let \eqn{S(t)} denote the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate at time \eqn{t}
#' for the combined data (control plus experimental treatment groups).
#' The weight at time \eqn{t} is then defined as
#' \deqn{w(t)=S(\min(t,t^*))^{-1}.}
