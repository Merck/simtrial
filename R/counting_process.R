#' Process survival data into counting process format
#'
#' Produces a data frame that is sorted by stratum and time.
#' Included in this is only the times at which one or more event occurs.
#' The output dataset contains stratum, TTE (time-to-event),
#' at risk count, and count of events at the specified TTE
#' sorted by stratum and TTE.
#'
#' @details
#' The function only considered two group situation.
#'
#' The tie is handled by the Breslow's Method.
#'
#' @param x A data frame with no missing values and contain variables:
#'   - `stratum`: Stratum.
#'   - `treatment`: Treatment group.
#'   - `tte`: Observed time.
#'   - `event`: Binary event indicator, `1` represents event,
#'     `0` represents censoring.
#' @param arm Value in the input `treatment` column that indicates
#'   treatment group value.
#'
#' @return
#' A data frame grouped by `stratum` and sorted within stratum by `tte`.
#' Remain rows with at least one event in the population, at least one subject
#' is at risk in both treatment group and control group.
#' Other variables in this represent the following within each stratum at
#' each time at which one or more events are observed:
#' - `events`: Total number of events
#' - `n_event_tol`: Total number of events at treatment group
#' - `n_risk_tol`: Number of subjects at risk
#' - `n_risk_trt`: Number of subjects at risk in treatment group
#' - `S`: Left-continuous Kaplan-Meier survival estimate
#' - `o_minus_e`: In treatment group, observed number of events minus expected
#'   number of events. The expected number of events is estimated by assuming
#'   no treatment effect with hypergeometric distribution with parameters total
#'   number of events, total number of events at treatment group and number of
#'   events at a time. (Same assumption of log-rank test under the null
#'   hypothesis)
#' - `var_o_minus_e`: Variance of `o_minus_e` under the same assumption.
