Description: simtrial provides some basic routines for simulating a
    clinical trial. The primary intent is to provide some tools to
    generate trial simulations for trials with time to event outcomes.
    Piecewise exponential failure rates and piecewise constant
    enrollment rates are the underlying mechanism used to simulate
    a broad range of scenarios. However, the basic generation of data
    is done using pipes to allow maximum flexibility for users to
    meet different needs.
