- 4 periods in dropout rates of the control arm per stratum
- 4 periods in dropout rates of the experimental arm per stratum

```
Further benchmark `doAnalysis`, we can see `tensurv` is the most time-consuming part.

Overall, the following functions take more than $10\%$ of the runtime in one simulation:

- `tensurv`. A single call of `tensurv` takes ~$20\%$ of the runtime in one simulation, but `tensurv` may be called multiple times (3 times in this example) in one simulation.
- `simPWSurvNew`. ~$10\%$. Only will be called once in one simulation.
- `cutData`. A single call of `cutData` takes ~$4\%$ of the runtime in one simulation, but `cutData` may be called multiple times (3 times in this example) in one simulation.
