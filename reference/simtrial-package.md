# simtrial: Clinical Trial Simulation

Provides some basic routines for simulating a clinical trial. The
primary intent is to provide some tools to generate trial simulations
for trials with time to event outcomes. Piecewise exponential failure
rates and piecewise constant enrollment rates are the underlying
mechanism used to simulate a broad range of scenarios such as those
presented in Lin et al. (2020)
[doi:10.1080/19466315.2019.1697738](https://doi.org/10.1080/19466315.2019.1697738)
. However, the basic generation of data is done using pipes to allow
maximum flexibility for users to meet different needs.
