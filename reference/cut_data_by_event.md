# Cut a dataset for analysis at a specified event count

Takes a time-to-event data set and cuts the data at which an event count
is reached.

## Usage

``` r
cut_data_by_event(x, event)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A time-to-event dataset, for example, generated by
  [`sim_pw_surv()`](https://merck.github.io/simtrial/reference/sim_pw_surv.md).

- event:

  Event count at which data cutoff is to be made.

## Value

A data frame ready for survival analysis, including columns time to
event (`tte`), `event`, the `stratum`, and the `treatment`. The class of
the data frame is `tte_data`, and the attribute `ratio` generated by
[`sim_pw_surv()`](https://merck.github.io/simtrial/reference/sim_pw_surv.md)
is also attached.

## Examples

``` r
# Use default enrollment and event rates at cut at 100 events
x <- sim_pw_surv(n = 200) |> cut_data_by_event(100)
table(x$event, x$treatment)
#>    
#>     control experimental
#>   0      44           48
#>   1      52           48
```
