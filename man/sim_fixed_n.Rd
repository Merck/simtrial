sim_fixed_n(
  n_sim = 1000,
  sample_size = 500,
  target_event = 350,
  stratum = data.frame(stratum = "All", p = 1),

  fail_rate = data.frame(stratum = "All", duration = c(3, 100), fail_rate = log(2)/c(9,
    18), hr = c(0.9, 0.6), dropout_rate = rep(0.001, 2)),

}
\arguments{
\item{n_sim}{Number of simulations to perform.}

\item{sample_size}{Total sample size per simulation.}

\item{target_event}{Targeted event count for analysis.}

\item{stratum}{A data frame with stratum specified in \code{stratum},
probability (incidence) of each stratum in \code{p}.}

\item{enroll_rate}{Piecewise constant enrollment rates by time period.
Note that these are overall population enrollment rates and the \code{stratum}
argument controls the random distribution between stratum.}

\item{fail_rate}{Piecewise constant control group failure rates, hazard ratio
for experimental vs. control, and dropout rates by stratum and time period.}

\item{total_duration}{Total follow-up from start of enrollment to data cutoff.}

\item{block}{As in \code{\link[=sim_pw_surv]{sim_pw_surv()}}. Vector of treatments to be included
in each block.}

\item{timing_type}{A numeric vector determining data cutoffs used;
see details. Default is to include all available cutoff methods.}

\item{rho_gamma}{A data frame with variables
\code{rho} and \code{gamma}, both greater than equal to zero,
to specify one Fleming-Harrington weighted logrank test per row.}
}
\value{
A data frame including columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{event}: Event count.
\item \code{ln_hr}: Log-hazard ratio.
\item \code{z}: Normal test statistic; < 0 favors experimental.
\item \code{cut}: Text describing cutoff used.
\item \code{duration}: Duration of trial at cutoff for analysis.
\item \code{sim}: Sequential simulation ID.
}

One row per simulated dataset per cutoff specified in \code{timing_type},
per test statistic specified.
If multiple Fleming-Harrington tests are specified in \code{rho_gamma},
then columns \code{rho} and \code{gamma} are also included.
}
\description{
\code{sim_fixed_n()} provides simulations of a single endpoint two-arm trial
where the enrollment, hazard ratio, and failure and dropout rates change
over time.
}
\details{
\code{timing_type} has up to 5 elements indicating different options
for data cutoff:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: Uses the planned study duration.
\item \code{2}: The time the targeted event count is achieved.
\item \code{3}: The planned minimum follow-up after enrollment is complete.
\item \code{4}: The maximum of planned study duration and targeted event count cuts
(1 and 2).
\item \code{5}: The maximum of targeted event count and minimum follow-up cuts
(2 and 3).
