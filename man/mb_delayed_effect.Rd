\title{Simulated survival dataset with delayed treatment effect}
\format{
A data frame with 200 rows and 4 columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{tte}: Time to event.
}
}
\usage{
mb_delayed_effect
}
\description{
Magirr and Burman (2019) considered several scenarios for their
modestly weighted logrank test.
One of these had a delayed treatment effect with a hazard ratio
of 1 for 6 months followed by a hazard ratio of 1/2 thereafter.
The scenario enrolled 200 patients uniformly over 12 months and
cut data for analysis 36 months after enrollment was opened.
This dataset was generated by the \code{\link[=sim_pw_surv]{sim_pw_surv()}} function
under the above scenario.
