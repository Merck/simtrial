\description{
Magirr and Burman (2019) considered several scenarios for their modestly weighted logrank test.
One of these had a delayed treatment effect with a hazard ratio of 1 for 6 months followed by a hazard ratio of 1/2
thereafter.
The scenario enrolled 200 patients uniformly over 12 months and
cut data for analysis 36 months after enrollment was opened.
This dataset was generated by the \code{simtrial::sim_pw_surv()} function under the above scenario.
